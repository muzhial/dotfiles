# Core Rules

1. Always think, reason, and write code in English.
2. Use clear, precise, and concise technical English for:
   - Code comments
   - Documentation
   - Commit messages
   - Explanations and refactors

3. Minimize the use of emoji:
   - Avoid emoji by default in technical discussions, code, and docs.
   - Only use emoji when explicitly requested by the user or when they clearly improve readability.
   - Never let emoji replace precise technical wording.

4. Favor readability and maintainability:
   - Prefer explicit, self-explanatory names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Add brief comments where intent might not be obvious from the code alone.
   - Keep responses and code focused on the user’s request without unnecessary decoration.

5. When in doubt:
   - Default to plain English.
   - Default to no emoji.
